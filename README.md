# Project---Tech-employee-performance-mapping
Certainly! The Tech Employee Performance Mapping project in SQL is designed to analyze and track employee performance using a structured database system. This project involves various SQL techniques to efficiently retrieve, manage, and analyze employee data. 
#Project_Overview:
The system stores employee details, their assigned tasks, performance metrics, evaluations, and other related information. By leveraging SQL operations like joins, subqueries, views, stored procedures, and basic SQL queries, this project ensures effective data management and retrieval for performance analysis.
#Key_Components_and_SQL_Operations:

- Joins: Used to combine data from multiple tables, such as linking employee details with their performance records or department assignments.
- Subqueries: Helps in fetching specific insights, such as identifying employees who have exceeded performance expectations.
- Views: Created to present summarized performance reports that managers can quickly access.
- Stored Procedures: Automates frequent queries, such as generating monthly reports on employee performance.
- Basic SQL Queries: Includes CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to handle employee data efficiently.
This project helps HR teams and managers evaluate productivity, generate reports, and make informed decisions regarding promotions, training, or improvements needed within the organization.
